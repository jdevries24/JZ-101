_update_
-JZ-102 Micro processor Has a redesigned control unit and PC select Unit.
-Jumping and Call instructions now move to a point offset and not to a set address.
-Complierer/Assembler has been modified to reflect this change. 
-Control Unit Modified to allow a debug mode and interrupts
-Microcode is now one very long word with individual bits controlling processor control.

_intro_
this is the J-64 computer. It is a computer that is designed in the logisim logic simulator although a Verilog 
implementation is on the horizon. The core of this computer is the JZ-101 microprocessor. Included in this directory
is the logisim file for the J-64 computer the JZ-101 processor and a assembler and compiler for the JZ-101

_JZ-101_ 
the JZ-101 microprocessor is a risc inspired microprocessor. Rather then lots of instructions that execute slowly
this Processes has a few instructions that execute quickly. Average of three cycles per instruction. not bad for a architecture 
with no pipeline. Additionally this is a load store architecture. Instead of meany addressing modes
this processer only has two instructions for loading and storing to memory. Load value to register from memory and store value from register
to memory.The processor is entirely 16bit. 16bit words that are word addressable,16bit addresses and 16 bit instructions.

Regesters:
the processor has 16 registers available to the programer R0 thought RF, 13 Registers (R1 -RC) are general purpose and can
be used for storing addresses, values,chesses what have you. Register R0 is hardwired to zero for a zero constant. 
Register RE also SP is the stack pointer. This register is special because the call and return instruction use the address
in this register for loading/storing the return address. Register RF or FR, is the flag register. this register is clobbered for 
Most Arithmetic instructions. 

Instruction format
|FEDCBA98|7654|3210| |FEBCBA9876543210|
 OPcode   SRC  Dest        Oprand
 
For each Instruction bits F-8 is the op code, The register number for the source
register are bits 7-4,The register number for the destination are bits 3-0.
If the instruction takes an operand such as a offset or address or ammount
That value is stored in the next word. 

example
|A0|4|1|,|0009|
|op|s|d|,|Oprn|

opcode is Load
the source register is 4
the destination register is 1
the operand is 0009

_J-64_
At the moment the computer is just the JZ-101 CPU, memory keyboard,terminal,and a I0 controller.
IO is provided by a keyboard and a terminal. The keyboard buffer is at address 0xFFFE.
To read the buffer read at this address to clear the last char write to that address.
The TTY is at address 0xFFFF write a char to here to type on the TTY. A "Disc Drive",Memory management
unit and an interrupt controller are coming soon.
